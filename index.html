<p>I've been in political science after I completed my undergraduate in the spring of 2006. Over those 12+ years, I've acquired several books along the way for either grad seminars or research. They make for a nice library but the truth is I don't need a lot of these books anymore. I want to give them to people who do need them.</p>

<p>That leads to this, for lack of a better term, "book co-op." Feel free to browse <a href="/books/">my collection</a>. If you see anything you like, reach out to me <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller">via Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:psbc@svmiller.com">via email</a> and let me know what you want. I'll send them to you with only a polite nudge that you could maybe pay it forward by chipping in some money to <a href="https://www.paypal.me/stevenvmiller">my PayPal</a> or maybe <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDLOCBK4RDNSYHATEQQGMNOYFMQ?ie=UTF8&preview=true">my Amazon account</a> as a thanks or a means to help defray future shipping costs. You could also find me at a political science conference like MPSA and buy me a beer.</p>

<p>Don't worry about it if you're a cash-strapped student; find another way to pay it forward down the road.</p>
