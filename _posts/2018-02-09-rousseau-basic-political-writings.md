## Physical Description

- **Condition**: Used, Good
- **Markings**: Extensive, throughout the book. Some pen underlining. Some faint highlighting. Some marginalia. Never concentrated in one area, nor too loud or distracting. Still worth noting.
- **Other comments**: Bought for a political theory class on the foundational stuff. Translated by Donald A. Cress. Introduced by Peter Gay. Published in 1987. First edition.
