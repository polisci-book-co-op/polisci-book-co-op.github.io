## Book Description (via Google Books)

> "This book fits right into a needed niche: rigorous enough to give full explanation of the power of the S language, yet accessible enough to assign to social science graduate students without fear of intimidation. It is a tremendous balance of applied statistical "firepower" and thoughtful explanation. It meets all of the important mechanical needs: each example is given in detail, code and data are freely available, and the nuances of models are given rather than just the bare essentials. It also meets some important theoretical needs: linear models, categorical data analysis, an introduction to applying GLMs, a discussion of model diagnostics, and useful instructions on writing customized functions. "
