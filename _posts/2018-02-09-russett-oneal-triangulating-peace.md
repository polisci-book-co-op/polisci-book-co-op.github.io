## Book Description (via Amazon)

> Triangulating Peace tackles todayâ€™s most provocative hypothesis in the field of international relations: the democratic peace proposition. Drawing on ideas originally put forth by Immanuel Kant, the authors argue that democracy, economic interdependence, and international mediation can successfully cooperate to significantly reduce the chances of war.

## Physical Description

- **Other comments**: Published in 1999.
