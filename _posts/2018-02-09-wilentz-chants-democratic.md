## Book Description

> Since its publication in 1984, Chants Democratic has endured as a classic narrative on labor and the rise of American democracy. In it, Sean Wilentz explores the dramatic social and intellectual changes that accompanied early industrialization in New York. He provides a panoramic chronicle of New York City's labor strife, social movements, and political turmoil in the eras of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Twenty years after its initial publication, Wilentz has added a new preface that takes stock of his own thinking, then and now, about New York City and the rise of the American working class.


## Physical Description

- **Condition**: Used, Very Good
- **Markings**: Faint yellow highlighter with occasional red underlining.
- **Other comments**: Bought it for an American political thought class in 2007. Excellent book if you're interested in America's "Jacksonian moment."
