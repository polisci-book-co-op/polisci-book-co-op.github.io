## Book Description (via Google Books)

>This book presents a new approach to the study of comparative politics that builds on the assumption that political actors and institutions operate within constructed communities of meaning, which in turn interface with other such communities. Accordingly, a comparative study of polities or the relations between polities (foreign policies, international relations) must incorporate a recognition of actors' identies, cultures, and worldviews, and the role of norms, rules, and ideas.
>
>The essays in the first part of the book explore the theoretical bases of this approach. The second part presents four case studies--of modern states and indigenous peoples in the Americas; democratic development in Benin, West Africa; culture industries and identity in Canada, France, and the EU; and the reconstruction of postwar Germany.
