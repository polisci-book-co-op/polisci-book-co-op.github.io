## Book Description

> A textbook for an undergraduate course in comparative political science, with elementary material that can be skipped by students with previous background in it. Adolino and Blake (both political science, James Madison U., Virginia) begin by exploring the role of cultural, economic, political, and institutional influences on policy making. Then they compare US policies with those in Japan and European countries on immigration, fiscal policy, taxation, health care, social policy, education, and the environment. Annotation c.

## Physical Description

- **Condition**: Used, Okay
- **Markings**: Extensive. Some marginalia and plenty of highlighting.
- **Other comments**: First edition. Published in 2001. Book was "used" when I bought it for my first grad class in 2006 (memories...). Previous owner was more aggressive in the highlighting and marginalia than I was.
